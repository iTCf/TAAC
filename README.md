# TAAC
TMS Adaptable Auditory Control

# Why using TAAC?
Pairing Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to Electroencephalography (EEG) is proven effective to probe the thalamocortical system. 
Nevetheless, this exam can be affected by undersired confoundings, so that auditory confounding due to TMS pulse delivery must be prevented. 

TAAC allows to early prevent the auditory contamination of TMS Evoked Potentials (TEPs) by masking the TMS click. To do so, TAAC generates a masking 
noise that can be adapted to each stimulator/coil (device specific) and can be customized to each subject (subject specific).
